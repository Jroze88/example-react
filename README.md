Tournament Tracking System (and in the future - global player ranking) for CMON's Game of Thrones Tabletop Miniature Game



Copyright CMON, Jano Roze, On the Table Gaming


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Desperately in need of optimization, time allowing 
(its practically stream-of-consciousness coding)

Testing different (redundant) methods, code that is technically unreachable, mix of architectures, managed by a hacky mix of react-state and redux-store - * ALL NEED SMOOTHING OUT *


*Tracks Tournament, generates pairings and seeded pairings for each round 
*Does NOT accept player-lists yet (of critical importance for analysis)
*Does NOT have an ELO system or player-signins yet. But all stats are stored.
*Will hopefully accept lists improted from CMON's official App (Warcouncil) pending their interest and approval
